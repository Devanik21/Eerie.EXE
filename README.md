### 👾 About
This repo contains multiple prank variants:  
- `eViL_gEniUs.py` → **NEW!** The ultimate prank with psychological tricks and desktop chaos.
- `liL_RisKy.py` → full chaos mode (ghost spams Notepad + glitches + whispers).  
- `liL_tHreAt.py` → lighter but still scary, perfect for demos.  
- `safer_ver_1.py` → entry-level prank, mostly harmless glitches.  

⚠️ All of them have **one sacred exit**: press **ESC** to banish the ghost.
